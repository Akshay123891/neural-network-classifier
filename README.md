# Neural Network for Classifying Letters A, B, and C (5x5 Pixel Patterns)

This project demonstrates how to build a simple **feedforward neural network from scratch using NumPy** to classify binary images of the letters **A**, **B**, and **C**. It uses manual backpropagation, sigmoid activation, softmax output, and gradient descent. The training process is visualized with `matplotlib`.
